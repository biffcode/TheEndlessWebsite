## Known Issues

### Navigation Bar

- **Issue**: Fantasy theme navigation bar height is inconsistent with other themes
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Tried reducing the image dimensions conditionally with width/height properties
  - Tried wrapping the image in a div with max-width constraint
  - Tried inline styles with maxWidth and height:auto
  - Applied fixed height and width constraints to containing elements
- **Current Status**: Partially resolved with fixed height header, but not ideal
- **Next Steps**: Investigate if this is a browser-specific rendering issue related to the fantasy logo

## To-Do

- [ ] Find a more elegant solution for fantasy logo display in navigation bar
- [ ] Consider redesigning the fantasy logo with the same dimensions/proportions as other theme logos
