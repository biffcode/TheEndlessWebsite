# Website Project - AI Start Here & Orientation

**Objective:** Welcome! This document is your primary orientation point for the "Endless Novel Website" project. It is designed to help you (or any future contributor) quickly understand the purpose, structure, and workflow of the website documentation system.

**Getting Started:** Begin here for context before working on the website or splash page.

## Purpose of This Documentation System

To ensure clarity, consistency, and a shared vision as we develop the public-facing website for Endless Novel. This system acts as our persistent memory, tracking goals, design decisions, and progress, and is especially helpful for onboarding new collaborators or resuming work after a break.

## Document Guide: Navigating the Website Docs

*   **`AI_START_HERE_WEBSITE.md` (This File):** Overview of the website documentation system and suggested workflow.
*   **`development_log_website.md`:** Our **website development journal**. Contains:
    *   Chronological entries detailing actions, decisions, and context.
    *   The team's **Current Focus**, **Next Steps**, and any **Blockers**.
    *   Review the latest entry here first to align on the current website task.
*   **`intent_website.md`:** The **website vision and design document**. Details:
    *   The purpose and goals of the website/splash page.
    *   Key messages, target audience, and desired style/tone.
    *   Planned sections/pages and content priorities.
    *   Design inspirations and technical considerations.
*   (Additional docs may be added as the project evolves.)

## Suggested Workflow for Website Development

1.  **Review this file (`AI_START_HERE_WEBSITE.md`)** for a reminder of the documentation structure and workflow.
2.  **Consult `development_log_website.md`:** Check the latest entry to understand the **Current Focus** and planned **Next Steps**.
3.  **Reference `intent_website.md`:** As needed, review relevant sections to refresh your understanding of the website's vision, goals, and design guidelines.
4.  **Gather Context Proactively:** Before making changes, review the latest docs and any relevant design assets or references.
5.  **Maintain the Log:** After significant actions or decisions, add a new entry to `development_log_website.md` to keep our shared journal current.
6.  **Request Human Assistance as a Tool Call:** If you encounter a task requiring creative, subjective, or strategic input, generate a clear chat message in the development log using the 'Request for Human Assistance' protocol. This is not a code function, but a formal message for human follow-up.
7.  **Update the Intent Document as Needed:** If your work leads to a change in project vision, goals, or major features, please update `intent_website.md` to reflect the new direction.

**Note:** The `intent_website.md` document is a living reference. Please update it whenever the project's vision, features, or priorities evolveâ€”not just at the start.

**The recommended first step is to check the latest entry in `development_log_website.md` to synchronize on our current position.**
