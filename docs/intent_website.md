# Endless Novel Website - Intent & Vision Document

## 1. Project Goal (Website/Splash Page)

**Vision:**
Endless Novel is more than a game—it's a next-generation, AI-powered adventure engine. Every story, character, item, and even the art and sound are generated on the fly by advanced AI models. Our goal is to create a living, breathing world where no two adventures are ever the same, and where the boundaries between player, developer, and AI are joyfully blurred.

**Core Objectives:**
*   Show the world what happens when game dev and AI dev collide—creativity, complexity, and fun at their peak.
*   Clearly explain what makes Endless Novel unique: a game engine where everything is generated, not just the story.
*   Invite visitors to follow development, join the community, or sign up for updates.
*   Lay the foundation for future expansion: dev blog, demo, FAQ, contact, and more.
*   Enable users to participate in the ecosystem through accounts, shared adventures, and sustainable monetization.
